<h1>&ltvideo&gt: The Video Embed element</h1>
<p>The &ltvideo&gt HTML element embeds a media player which supports video 
  playback into the document. You can use &ltvideo&gt for audio content as 
  well, but the &ltaudio&gt element may provide a more appropriate user 
  experience.
</p>
<video controls width="750">
  <source type="video/webm" src="oceanview.mp4">
  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>
<p>The above example shows simple usage of the &ltvideo&gt element. In a 
  similar manner to the &ltimg&gt element, we include a path to the media we 
  want to display inside the src attribute; we can include other attributes to 
  specify information such as video width and height, whether we want it to 
  autoplay and loop, whether we want to show the browser's default video 
  controls, etc.
</p>
<p>The content inside the opening and closing &ltvideo&gt&lt/video&gt tags is 
  shown as a fallback in browsers that don't support the element.
