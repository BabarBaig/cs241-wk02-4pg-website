<h3>&ltiframe&gt: The Inline Frame element</h3>
<p>The &ltiframe&gt HTML element represents a nested browsing context, embedding 
  another HTML page into the current one.
</p>
<p>Each embedded browsing context has its own session history and document. The 
  browsing context that embeds the others is called the *parent browsing 
  context*. The *topmost* browsing context — the one with no parent — is usually 
  the browser window, represented by the Window object.
</p>
<p>Warning: Because each browsing context is a complete document environment, 
  every &ltiframe&gt in a page requires increased memory and other computing 
  resources. While theoretically you can use as many &ltiframe&gts as you like, 
  check for performance problems.
