<h1>What are CSS Animations?</h1>
<p>An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.
</p>
<p>
You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want.
</p>
<p>
To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.
</p>
<p>
Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.
The @keyframes Rule
</p>
<p>When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will 
gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times.
</p>
<p>To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.
</p>
<p>The following example binds the "example" animation to the &ltdiv&gt element.
  The animation will last for 10 seconds, and it will gradually change the 
  background-color of the &ltdiv&gt element from "red" to "yellow":
</p>
<div></div>
<p><b>Note:</b> When an animation is finished, it goes back to its original style.</p>
