<p>Welcome to CS241 Week Lab 1</p>
<p>This lab comprises 4 pages.  This is the main page.  In the remaining 3 
   pages, we'll introduces some uncommon HTML and CSS features.
</p>
<p>See below for assignment details.

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<h3>Lab 1: A Static Website</h3>
<p>For this lab, you will create a simple tutorial website that teaches people
   how to use some more advanced HTML tags and CSS features.
</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
Your website should have four pages:
<ul>
  <li> A 'welcome' page that briefly introduces your site and has hyperlinks
       to and descriptions of your three other pages.</li>
  <li> Three pages to teach readers how to use different uncommon HTML or CSS
       features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of your three tutorial pages will teach about ONE tag or CSS feature 
  from the list below (if you have another feature in mind, feel free to ask 
  if you can substitute that instead):
</p>
<ol>
  <li>&ltol&gt and &ltul&gt lists</li>
  <li>&ltvideo&gt tags</li>
  <li>HTML &lttable&gts</li>
  <li>&ltiframe&gt tags</li>
  <li>The CSS @media directive</li>
  <li>CSS keyframe animations</li>
  <li>CSS @font imported font faces</li>
</ol>
A tutorial page should have around a paragraph of text about your tag, and then
a working example of that tag in action that you reference in your text. For 
example, look at how MDN describes and demos the video tag here:
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video">MDN 
video tag</a>> (you don't need to go into nearly as much detail.) MDN has 
articles explaining how to use every feature in this list above; I strongly 
recommend finding their resources to help you learn how to use these tags 
before you write your own examples.
<h3>Styling</h3>
Your website should make use of CSS to style your text and elements. Your CSS 
should be included in a shared .css file that is linked to all four pages on 
your demo site. At minimum, this CSS should change the styling and positioning 
of all your text in paragraphs, and change either the background of the entire 
page or the background of another element. Try experimenting with the margin 
and width rules to center the main content area.
<h3>Uploading</h3>
When you are done creating your site, test it out on your local nginx server. 
When you are sure everything works (you can navigate between the pages and see 
all of your elements styled appropriately), create a .zip file containing all 
of your site's code. Upload that archive to this assignment by clicking the 
title of the lab and attaching the .zip on the upload page. Note: If you try 
to upload .html files directly, Blackboard will edit and break your webpage.
